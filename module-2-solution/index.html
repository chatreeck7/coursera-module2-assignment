                <p class="definition">Manhattan is home to many smells, but perhaps the most delicious is the chicken-y, savory scent that emanates from from the city's countless halal carts. Serving lunch to late-night, these carts dish up a container full of chicken rice that tastes like nothing else, crave-worthy and totally singular. To taste this particular chicken and rice you can get yourself to Midtown or try this home version by Kenji, a spot-on rendition of the street food classic. Marinated in oregano, lemon, and coriander, chicken thighs are browned, chopped into chunks and served over a pile turmeric-yellow rice. Of course, it wouldn't be halal-cart style without the ubiquitous (and none too fancy) salad of iceberg and tomatoes, and that mysterious sweet-sour-tangy white sauce that just has to be ladled all over the chicken and rice for true street-style authenticity.

                    A popular Russian food dish that is typically made from thinly sliced beef taken from a tender cut of meat, which is quickly sautéed in butter with sliced mushrooms and onions. The sautéed mixture is then combined with a sour cream sauce and is most often served over a rice pilaf or noodles. Although beef is the most common meat used to make Stroganov, which is then referred to as Beef Stroganov, other meats can also be used to make this dish such as chicken
